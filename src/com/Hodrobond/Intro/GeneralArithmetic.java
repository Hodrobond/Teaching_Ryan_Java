 * Created by hodrobond on 6/27/17.
 * Your goal is to implement the functions for general arithmetic.
 * These include:
 * Addition- 5 + 4 = 9
 * Subtraction- 12 - 5 = 7
 * Mulitplication- 4 * 7 = 28
 * Division- 12 / 4 = 3
 * Please note the function parameters need to be filled in, however
 * the function type has already been specified
